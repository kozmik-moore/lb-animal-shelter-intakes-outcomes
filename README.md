## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a retail sales dataset using Python libraries `pandas` and `seaborn`. The goal is to uncover trends, detect anomalies, and visualize key insights to support data-driven decision-making.

This is a portfolio project created to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization using Python. It highlights my ability to work with real-world datasets, derive meaningful insights, and communicate results clearly through code and visualizations.

## Data Sources

List the datasets used in your analysis, with a brief description for each.

Example:

- **File**: `sales_data.csv`
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Description**: Contains daily sales data for multiple stores and product categories over a 2-year period.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Install dependencies

Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run a Jupyter Notebook

Start the Jupyter server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open and run notebooks from the `notebooks/` directory to explore data and generate visualizations.

### Run a script

You can also run any standalone scripts from the command line:

```bash
python scripts/data_cleaning.py
```

Ensure the data paths are correctly configured inside the script or pass them as arguments.

## Results

Summarize key findings or outcomes from the analysis. You can include static images or link to output files.

Example:

- Sales peaked during Q4 across all regions.
- Category A had the highest growth YoY.
- Outliers detected in January due to inventory misreporting.

See full visual report in `output/report.html`.

## Technologies Used
